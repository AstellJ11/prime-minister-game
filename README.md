# Programming and Data Structures - Prime Minister Game (CMP1127M_Assessment_03)


## Overview
A text based game where the user is presented with 3 prime ministers. They have to guess which of them served first. 5 rounds are played and the user is presented with a score at the end. Exception handling is used to prevent the same name (for a prime minister who served at different times) being shown.
